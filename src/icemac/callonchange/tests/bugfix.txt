=============================
 Bugfixes in buildout recipe
=============================

There were some bugs in the recipe.

Find-links not correctly parsed
===============================

When the buildout has a find-links parameter, error messages were displayed. This is now fixed:

>>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
... """
... [buildout]
... parts = coc
... find-links = %s
...
... [coc]
... recipe = icemac.callonchange
... """ % sample_buildout)

After running buildout the script gets created in the `bin` directory:

>>> import os, os.path
>>> os.chdir(sample_buildout)
>>> buildout = os.path.join(sample_buildout, 'bin', 'buildout')
>>> print system(buildout),
Installing coc.
Generated script '/.../sample-buildout/bin/callonchange'.
