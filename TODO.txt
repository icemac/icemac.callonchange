=======
 To do
=======

- Default arguments do not allow to use `callonchange` on command line.
  (maybe for buildout integration a recipe is needed)

- Not useable for latex documents as calling `latex document.tex` changes
  the directory which leads to calling it over and over again.
  (Need option to select document extension for which the script should be
  called.)
