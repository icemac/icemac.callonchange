Ideas
=====

- It would be nice to have predefined argument lines (profiles) even
  when not using buildout. They could be stored in the home directory
  of the user. (Should support profiles which reverence other
  profiles.)

- In buildout recipe: default script name should be section name.

- A minimal time between calls might be nice, so a change does not
  result in a call when it occurred during this time.

- The options of callonchange should have long variants, too.

- Compatibility with Python versions beside 2.5 would be nice.
