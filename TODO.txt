To do
=====

- Ease buildout integration by providing a buildout recipe with
  default arguments.

- icemac.callonchange is currently not useable in situations where the
  command changes something in the observed diretory. (e. g. LaTeX
  documents can't be created with it as the creation changes the
  observed diretory which starts creation ... over and over again.
  (Need an ability to select file extension(s) for which the command
  should be run.)
